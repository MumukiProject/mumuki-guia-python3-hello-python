One of the many things we can do with Python is math. Even though it sounds boring :sleeping:, learning to do these calculations will help us later when working with other types of data :star_struck:

For these calculations we'll use the _console_, a very useful tool to quickly test what we're doing. You can easily recognize it by the fact that it starts with the _squiggle_ ム called [ _prompt_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command_prompt).

> Let's start testing! Copy and paste next to the `ム` symbol the following expressions in order:
>
> ``` python
ム2 * 3
```
>
> ``` python
ム8 + 7
```
>
> ``` python
ム21 / 7
```
>
> ``` python
ム11 - 2
```
> Press `↵ Enter` after each one.
