As we just saw in Python we can multiply :heavy_multiplication_x:, divide :heavy_division_sign:, :heavy_plus_sign: and subtract :heavy_minus_sign:. In programming, these symbols are called _operators_ and are written slightly differently:

| Operation      | Operator | Example  |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Addition       | `+`      | `4 + 9`  |
| Subtraction    | `-`      | `12 - 2` |
| Multiplication | `*`      | `2 * 3`  |
| Division       | `/`      | `16 / 2` |
 
Great! :tada: Does that mean we can use the console to do any calculation we want? :thinking:
