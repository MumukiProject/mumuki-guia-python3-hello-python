Let's formalize what these operations do before moving on :wink: :

* `abs`: tells us the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value) of a number;
* `round`: returns the rounding of a number;
* `max`: given two numbers, it tells which is the largest;
* `min`: is similar to `max` but returns the smallest number.
