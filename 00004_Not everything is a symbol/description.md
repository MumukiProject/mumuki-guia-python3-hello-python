Fortunately, not all operations we can do are such _squiggles_. Besides the mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`, there are other common operations which come with Python out of the box. :raised_hands:

Unlike the operators we've seen so far, these work a little differently. We specify the input values, called _arguments_, between parentheses and get an output value from them, called _return_.

> Try the following operations in the console and see what each one returns:
>
> ``` python
ムabs(-123)
```
>
> ``` python
ムround(4.3)
```
>
> ``` python
ムmax(8, 7)
```
>
> ``` python
ムmin(8, 7)
```

> What will happen if we try `abs` with a positive number? Will `round(4.6)` return the same thing as `round(4.6)`? 
> If you can't figure out what each value does, you can try other values.
