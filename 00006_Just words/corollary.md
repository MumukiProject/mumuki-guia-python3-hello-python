Great :grin:

In case you're wondering what the `str` is, it's our way of converting numbers to strings. If we had written instead...

``` python
ãƒ "I need " + 5
```

... it would have thrown a `TypeError`:  `can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`. In other words, strings can only be concatenated with other strings. :person_shrugging:
