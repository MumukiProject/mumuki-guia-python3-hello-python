:speaking_head: CAPITAL LETTERS SOUND AGGRESSIVE, RIGHT? NOT TO SPEAK IF WE ADD EXCLAMATION MARKS TO THEM!

Fortunately, on the other hand, we have the quiet lowercase letters. In Python, we can convert a text from uppercase to lowercase and vice versa. We can also remove the leading and trailing spaces from a string, because there are times when they just don't care. ðŸ¤·

> Let's test `str.strip`, `str.upper` and `str.lower` in the console by copying and pasting the following expressions in order:
>
>``` python
ãƒ str.strip("	  Why so many spaces?	  ")
```
>
>``` python
ãƒ str.lower('TURN DOWN THE VOLUME')
```
>
>``` python
ãƒ str.lower('we already did it')
```
>
>``` python
ãƒ str.upper('Thanks!')
```
>
>``` python
ãƒ str.upper('I NEED LARGER CAPS')
```
> Can you imagine what will happen in each case?
