The comments were ignored! :confused:

That's fine, the comments are just there for people, and they're there to communicate and remind things to our future selves :brain:

If we want to make comments of more than one line, known precisely as multiline, we write them in one of the two following ways:

```python
"""
Hi I am...
a multiline comment!
"""

'''
What a coincidence!
Me too
Nice to meet you  :)
'''
```
